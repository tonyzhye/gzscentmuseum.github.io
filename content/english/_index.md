      Since ancient times, perfumes and fragrances have been an indispensable part of human civilization. They not only embody the artistic wisdom of perfumers, but also carry profound historical cultures and regional characteristics. As a bridge linking the past and the future, the Shamian Perfume and Fragrance Museum of Guangzhou is committed to guiding every visitor stepping into this space on a time-transcending fragrance journey through its carefully curated permanent exhibitions.<br><br>

      We believe that the permanent exhibitions of the Perfume and Fragrance Museum will be more than just a visual and olfactory feast; they will also be a spiritual experience and a cultural exploration. We hope that every visitor can find their own unique fragrance memory during this journey, and together witness the brilliant radiance of perfumes and fragrances in the long river of human civilization.
